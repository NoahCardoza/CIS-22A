COMPUTER EXPERIENCE:
	| I have always spent a lot of time tinkering on my computer(s).
	| I REALLY started programming about 3 years ago in Python 2 and now I
	| am relatively fluent in Python 2/3, JavaScript (both client and server side).
	| I Know a good amount of HTML/CSS but prefer not to bother with it.
	| In 2016 I passed a 42 C and Ruby piscine (https://www.42.us.org/).
	| I wrote my first and only C++ program a few weeks before this class
	| (https://github.com/NoahCardoza/cpp-tic-tac-toe).
	| I push most of my project to Github (https://github.com/NoahCardoza).
	|  
	| A few closing statements:
	| -> C++ == C
	| -> ++C > C
	| -> CLI >= GUI
	| -> Zsh >= Bash
